# Archive Bot

Chat command line interface that allows one to choose URLs, push them with metadata to a JSON-LD file, a markdown file, and a screenshot file, and store as an archival record. To run the bot: download the files, navigate to the directory where you opened the downloaded files, and run the command, 'node index.js'.

## Getting Started
 1. [Install npm and node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) on your local machine.
 2. [Download the archive-bot files](https://github.com/jasonclark/archive-bot/archive/main.zip) or clone the repository.
 3. Open the files in a directory. To get the necessary node_modules, run (from that directory on a bash prompt): 
```npm update```
 4. Start the archive-bot from a bash prompt by running: 
```node index.js```
 5. Follow the conversation prompts and create your archive.
